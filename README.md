## How to use cad2mc:
I made a tutorial video that shows you exactly how to use this tool: https://youtu.be/EUO-GYvIjhg

1. Download the **cad2mc.exe** file and the **obj2voxel-v1.3.4.exe** files into a folder on your machine.
2. Save a 3d file into the same folder or use the example files provided: tinker.obj and obj.mtl
3. Run the **cad2mc.exe** file and follow the prompts
4. Open Minecraft Education Edition and paste the clipboard into the MakeCode editor as Python code
5. Hit the green play button and return to the world
6. Type **buildnow** into the chat and watch your model build block by block in the world!

## To Do:
1. Make a web based version for users who cannot run the .exe file
2. Publish directions to run this natively in Python instead of the .exe
3. Support for Bedrock and Java edition
